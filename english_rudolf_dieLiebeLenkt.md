# Only heroes dare

What if it were true?
This new world that you see
The sky is always blue.
freedom always free.

When tomorrow comes
Will the crowds still cheer
When tomorrow comes
will he still be here?

Such a foolish heart
Such a reckless soul
who from the very start,
was born to play his role.

Poised on the abyss

far above it all
Raised up by a kiss
high enough to fall

But for a moment or two
he was pure and strong
and for a moment or two
we were swept along

And for that moment or two
he was pure and strong
and for a moment or two
we were swept along

Hear the distant drums
draw nearer every day
tomorrow this way comes
to fetch the fools away.

Still although I swear
By the Gods above
Only heroes dare
To be fools for love
