Somebody asking who are you? Where you going?
I start to answer, they turn their eyes away
My name's the only thing that they are ever knowing
But all the rest is all there is to say

Somebody asking, "whatever are you thinking?"
I start to tell them until they turn away
A thought is spoken only to a total stranger
And all the rest is for another day

Behind a window, I stand and watch the people
The kind of window that I can never break
No matter how I try to push my heart against it
It keeps on bending with every move I make
Beyond the window, the world goes on without me
Life goes by me while here I... stay

If I'm lonely, I write a long long letter
I never send it, so no one writes me back
And though I know somebody else could write is better
Still I keep trying with all the words I lack

The window's bending, but still I push against it
Keep pushing, hoping someday the glass will break
But windows on the world, they pay no mind to people
Who everyday keep making same mistake

Outside the window, the world is very busy
With plans and passions and places they should be
While I keep dreaming of the day the glass will shatter
And a stranger will smile and finally see
A silly person behind a bending window
A window bending inside of me
