From here and from afar  
and walks of mountain ash  
where forests burned  
and wind gave way to  
battle cries  
Where fields of crops untouched  
Where fruit have rotten black  
Day is nigh  

Sunshine will welcome us to our land  
and look as the blood-soa-ked ground  
feeds us again as it coats with rye's  
golden dust  

Women will open their door for us  
and look, they will laugh through the tears  
music will lead us into a dance  
soon enough  

a day, or two,   
a night, or three,  
it will be  

a day, a night  
will pass until  
dusk is here  

We'll light up the ovens to bake our bread  
and look, where there's ashes and smoke  
blossom will heal up the wounds of war   
life will grow   

Someday we'll welcome a newborn child  
and look, they will laugh back at us  
for clinging to stories of long-gone times,  
war-torn past
