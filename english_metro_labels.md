You pick up the papers
The world's gone to hell
It's all topsy turvey
How can you tell
The top from the bottom
The have's from have not

Thank God for labels
They're all that we've got

Russians are crazy
Germans will beat you
after they lose
Chinese will duck you
Frenchman will fuck you
Jews all have talent
Too bad they're Jews

Yankees will love you,
punch you and shove you
Slavs kill each other
as fast as they can

English will rule you
Arabs will fool you
The world will soon be
owned by Japan
