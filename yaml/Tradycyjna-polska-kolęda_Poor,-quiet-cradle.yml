	Poor, quiet cradle  
	Forgotten stable  
	Full of heavenly glory  
	
	Baby is sleeping  
	No sound of weeping  
	Jesus the saviour born here  
	
	Angels flew over  
	To watch Him closer  
	Lighting the dark with haloes  
	
	Golden hair glowing  
	When they are bowing  
	Over their heads bright rainbow  
	
	People of goodwill  
	Prophecy's fulfilled  
	Your misery has ended  
	
	Here comes salvation  
	To all the nations  
	God born as man descended
