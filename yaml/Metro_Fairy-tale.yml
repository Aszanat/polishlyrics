BASIA
	Last night I danced a lovely dance
	Though it was only in my sleep
	Someone held me in his arms
	And whispered promises
	That in the morning would be broken
	
	ALICJA (& BASIA)
	I'd like to live a fairy tale
	(Fairy tale like cinderella at the ball)
	All I am is someone who
	(Someone who sometime needs)
	Somebody holds a while
	(to dream)
	
	ALICJA & BASIA
	I'm no one special after all
	
	ALICJA (& BASIA)
	So I close my eyes and see
	(Someone graceful I can see)
	Until the night is over
	(in the mirror in my room)
	There's so much I want to be
	(someone I can only be)
	sleeping here, here in me
	
	ALICJA & BASIA
	When I dance in my dreams
	
	DENISA
	Last night I danced a lovely dance
	
	BASIA (& ALICJA)
	Deep in the night
	(All dressed in white)
	
	DENISA
	And ever after was in sight
	
	BASIA (& ALICJA)
	A fairy princess dancing on till dawn's early light
	(For one night)
	
	DENISA (& BASIA [& ALICJA])
	Shining knights will save the day
	(The dawn comes I awake to)
	[At least as long as]
	Fairy tales can come true
	(only me)
	[I can dream]
	At least in dreams, they always seem to
	(When will I wake up to someone)
	[I dance for me]
	
	Last night I danced the night away
	[so let the music play]
	(Last night I danced the night away)
	Though it was only in my sleep
	(I dreamed I danced)
	[until the]
	
	BASIA & ALICJA
	Morning comes the fairy tale is over
	
	DENISA (& BASIA [& ALICJA])
	Someone held me in his arms
	(I danced)
	[I trip and fall and lose my shoe]
	
	DENISA & BASIA & ALICJA
	Within a fairy tale I'm
	
	DENISA & BASIA [& ALICJA]
	No one special after all
	[someone who lives for a page]
	I'm no one's fairy princess now
	[of someone else's tale]
	
	DENISA (& BASIA [& ALICJA])
	And no one dream of me
	
	BASIA & ALICJA
	I want to shine on my own
	
	DENISA
	Shining brightly
	
	DENISA & BASIA
	Like a firefly
	
	DENISA & BASIA & ALICJA
	Will I never ever be in a fairy tale
	
	DENISA (& BASIA [& ALICJA])
	[Never happy ever after]
	Dressed in white
	(like a fairy tale)
	
	DENISA & ALICJA (& BASIA)
	Will tomorrow never bring a chance for me to shine (never bring a chance)
	
	
	DENISA & BASIA [& ALICJA]
	Catch a dream and make it mine
	[catch a dream and make it mine]
	
	DENISA
	A dream that's only
	
	DENISA & ALICJA
	mine
	
	DENISA & BASIA & ALICJA
	Someone real who's loving me
	Dreams can't fail
	
	DENISA (BASIa & ALICJA)
	Whenever I
	(When I)
	
	DENISA & BASIA & ALICJA
	Dance in my fairy tale
