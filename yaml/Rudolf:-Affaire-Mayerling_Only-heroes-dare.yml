	What if it were true?
	This new world that you see
	The sky is always blue.
	freedom always free.
	
	When tomorrow comes
	Will the crowds still cheer
	When tomorrow comes
	will he still be here?
	
	Such a foolish heart
	Such a reckless soul
	who from the very start,
	was born to play his role.
	
	Poised on the abyss
	
	far above it all
	Raised up by a kiss
	high enough to fall
	
	But for a moment or two
	he was pure and strong
	and for a moment or two
	we were swept along
	
	And for that moment or two
	he was pure and strong
	and for a moment or two
	we were swept along
	
	Hear the distant drums
	draw nearer every day
	tomorrow this way comes
	to fetch the fools away.
	
	Still although I swear
	By the Gods above
	Only heroes dare
	To be fools for lovesource: |
