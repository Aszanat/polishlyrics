	You pick up the papers
	The world's gone to hell
	It's all topsy turvey
	How can you tell
	The top from the bottom
	The have's from have not
	
	Thank God for labels
	They're all that we've got
	
	Russians are crazy
	Germans will beat you
	after they lose
	Chinese will duck you
	Frenchman will fuck you
	Jews all have talent
	Too bad they're Jews
	
	Yankees will love you,
	punch you and shove you
	Slavs kill each other
	as fast as they can
	
	English will rule you
	Arabs will fool you
	The world will soon be
	owned by Japan
