	From here and from afar  
	and walks of mountain ash  
	where forests burned  
	and wind gave way to  
	battle cries  
	Where fields of crops untouched  
	Where fruit have rotten black  
	Day is nigh  
	
	Sunshine will welcome us to our land  
	and look as the blood-soa-ked fields  
	feed us again as they coat with rye's  
	golden dust  
	
	Women will open their door for us  
	and look, they will laugh through the tears  
	music will lead us into a dance  
	soon enough  
	
	a day, or two,   
	a night, or three,  
	but not now
	
	a day, a night  
	they too shall pass 
	dusk will come 
	
	We'll light up the ovens to bake our bread  
	and look, where there's ashes and smoke  
	blossom will heal up the wounds of war   
	life will grow   
	
	Someday our children will shake their heads  
	and look, they will laugh that their folks  
	cling to the stories of long-gone storms,  
	times of woe
