	From four sides of the world  
	From roads of rowan trees  
	Where forest burnt  
	And wind’s worn out  
	Where night and front  
	Where unharvested corn  
	Where desiccated leaves  
	Day begins
	
	Sun will invite us to hug her arms  
	Behold: the land heavy with blood  
	Will once again bear us fields of wheat  
	Golden dune  
	
	Women will take us inside their house  
	Behold: through worst tears they will laugh  
	Again on the dance floor we’ll move our feet  
	Maybe soon  
	
	In a day, in two,  
	In a night, in three,  
	But not now
	
	In a day, and night  
	This too shall pass  
	Sun will rise  
	
	Ovens will soon bake us fresh, warm bread  
	Behold: There where was only smoke,  
	Flowers will sew up the war’s remains  
	Grass will grow  
	Some day our children will shake their heads  
	Behold: they will laugh that their folks  
	Talk once again of these cruel days,  
	Time of storms
