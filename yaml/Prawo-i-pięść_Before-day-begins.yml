	From here and from afar
	and walks of mountain ash
	where forests burned
	and wind gave way to
	battle cries
	Where fields of crops untouched
	Where fruit have rotten black
	Day is nigh
	
	Sunshine will welcome us to our land
	and look as the blood-soa-ked ground
	feeds us again as it coats with rye's
	golden dust
	
	Women will open their door for us
	and look, they will laugh through the tears
	music will lead us into a dance
	soon enough
	
	a day, or two, 
	a night, or three,
	it will be
	
	a day, a night
	will pass until
	dusk is here
	
	We'll light up the ovens to bake our bread
	and look, where there's ashes and smoke
	blossom will heal up the wounds of war 
	life will grow  
	
	Someday we'll welcome a newborn child
	and look, they will laugh back at us
	for clinging to stories of long-gone times,
	war-torn past
